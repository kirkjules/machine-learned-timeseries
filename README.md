# htp: A High Throughput Python Package to Query FX, Develop Trading Strategies and Establish a Live Platform.

### Introduction

* No package exists that incorporates all aspects of financial timeseries quantative technical analysis, including the data exploration, strategy design and testing, and live deployment.
* The aim is to provide a complete pipeline that can be used in parts or entirely.
* Once completed, this project will overcome issues that prevent success in financialanalysis.

### Technologies

* The focus dataset will be FX and CFD, as afforded by Oanda's v20 API.
  * However, the implicit modular strucuture will facilitate evaluation of externally sourced timeseries data.
* The foundations of this project will consist of Pandas, for data housing, and Flask, for project structure. Additionally, AWS Lambda is to be leveraged for multiprocessing requirements.
* This is an endeavour to be produce a polished body of work written in python 3.7. The test of this project will be its ability to evolve with new technologies as they become available.
